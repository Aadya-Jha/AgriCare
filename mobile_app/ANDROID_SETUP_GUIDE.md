   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "C:\flutter"
   
   # Download Flutter (you can also download from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)
   # Download the stable release zip file and extract to C:\flutter
   ```

2. **Add Flutter to PATH**
   ```powershell
   # Add Flutter to system PATH
   $env:PATH += ";C:\flutter\bin"
   
   # To make it permanent, add to system environment variables
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:PATH + ";C:\flutter\bin", "User")
   ```

### Step 2: Install Android Studio

1. **Download Android Studio**
   - Go to https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Download Android Studio for Windows
   - Install with default settings

2. **Install Android SDK**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to `File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK`
   - Install the latest Android SDK (API 33 or 34)
   - Install Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Install Android Emulator

### Step 3: Set up Android SDK Environment Variables

```powershell
# Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
$androidHome = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANDROID_HOME", $androidHome, "User")

# Add Android SDK tools to PATH
$newPath = $env:PATH + ";$androidHome\tools;$androidHome\tools\bin;$androidHome\platform-tools"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $newPath, "User")

# Reload environment variables
$env:ANDROID_HOME = $androidHome
$env:PATH = $newPath
```

## üîß Flutter Configuration

### Step 4: Verify Flutter Installation

```powershell
# Restart PowerShell and run
flutter doctor

# This will show what needs to be installed/configured
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

### Step 5: Accept Android Licenses

```powershell
# Accept all Android SDK licenses
flutter doctor --android-licenses
# Type 'y' for all prompts
```

## üì± Create Android Virtual Device (AVD)

### Step 6: Set up Android Emulator

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Go to AVD Manager**
   - `Tools > AVD Manager` or click the AVD Manager icon
3. **Create Virtual Device**
   - Click `Create Virtual Device`
   - Choose `Phone > Pixel 4` or similar
   - Download and select a system image (API 30+ recommended)
   - Configure AVD settings:
     - Name: `Agri_Monitor_Test`
     - Advanced Settings: 
       - RAM: 4GB or more
       - Internal Storage: 8GB or more
       - SD Card: 2GB
4. **Start Emulator**
   - Click the play button to start the emulator

### Alternative: Command Line AVD Creation

```powershell
# List available system images
avdmanager list targets

# Create AVD via command line
avdmanager create avd -n "Agri_Monitor_Test" -k "system-images;android-30;google_apis;x86_64" -d "pixel_4"

# Start emulator
emulator -avd Agri_Monitor_Test
```

## üöÄ Running the Mobile App

### Step 7: Navigate to Project Directory

```powershell
# Navigate to the mobile app directory
cd "C:\Users\Gayatri Gurugubelli\agri-monitoring-platform\mobile_app"
```

### Step 8: Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# If there are any issues, clean and get again
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Step 9: Check Connected Devices

```powershell
# Check if emulator is detected
flutter devices

# You should see your emulator listed
```

### Step 10: Run the Application

```powershell
# Run the app on the emulator
flutter run

# Or run with specific device
flutter run -d emulator-5554

# For debug mode with hot reload
flutter run --debug
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Flutter Not Recognized
```powershell
# Verify Flutter is in PATH
flutter --version

# If not working, restart PowerShell and check PATH
echo $env:PATH
```

### Issue 2: Android SDK Not Found
```powershell
# Check Android SDK location
flutter doctor -v

# Set ANDROID_HOME if needed
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Android\Sdk"
```

### Issue 3: Emulator Not Starting
```powershell
# Check available AVDs
emulator -list-avds

# Start specific AVD
emulator -avd Agri_Monitor_Test -no-snapshot-load
```

### Issue 4: Build Errors
```powershell
# Clean project
flutter clean

# Update dependencies
flutter pub get

# Rebuild
flutter run
```

### Issue 5: Permission Issues
